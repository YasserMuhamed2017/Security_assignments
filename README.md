In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined
steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to
convert information into cipher or code. I used here two types of Ciphers like Shift and Affine Ciphers.
